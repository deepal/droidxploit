Introduction to Android Penetration testing

Since the openness of the app development of android, there are large amount of apps developed by various developers that seems to be very useful and user friendly. But the danger is, only few regular android users are concerned about the underlying software vulnerabilities and security holes in apps which attackers may use to cause devastating damages. Penetration testing is the technique used by security engineers where they try to attack their own software products and after strengthen them in security level so that no attackers can use them for harmful effects.



Android Exploitation Framework

Proposing Android Exploitation Framework can be used by Security Experts and Engineers for penetration testing. Using this Exploitation Framework they can exploit security vulnerabilities using an exploit from a set of possible exploits for that particular vulnerability and inject a preferred payload to be executed after exploitation.
This framework can contribute in a larger scale in making penetration testing more easy and making Android Operating system and apps more secure and reliable.
